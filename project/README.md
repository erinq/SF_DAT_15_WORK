## SF_DAT_15  Project
Final project for GA data science class.

I will be working on the active Kaggle competition about crime statistics in the Bay area.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data

Once I have a working model for crime prediction (type of crime based on time and location of the crime), I will try this model on data from another city or cities.

The project might extend to looking and the differences and similarities of crime prediction by city.

Additional datasets might be found looking at open data for a specific city, through 538.com, or through socrata.
